### Code Explanation

The code uses JavaScript to interact with a local server and update the webpage accordingly. It fetches movie data from the server, displays movie information, and allows users to purchase tickets and delete movies.

The global variable movieDetails is used to store the movie details.
The updateMovieDetails function updates the movie details displayed on the webpage.
The DOMContentLoaded event listener fetches movie details and sets up event listeners for interacting with the movies.
The fetch API is used to interact with the server, including fetching movie details, updating tickets, and deleting movies.
Event listeners are set up for various interactions, such as clicking on a movie or purchasing tickets.
